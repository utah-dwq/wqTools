\description{
This function pulls information from EPA ATTAINS database based on submitted arguments via ATTAINS web service. Any ATTAINS web service compatible argument can be submitted to this funciton. Depending on type, at least one argument may be required. See https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/how-access-and-use-attains-web-services for a list of required and compatible arguments.
The function is essentially an ATTAINS specific wrapper for jsonlite::fromJSON. It generates the appropriate web path to connect to ATTAINS web service and converts JSON to R object.
